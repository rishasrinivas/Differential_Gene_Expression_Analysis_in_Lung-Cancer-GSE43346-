BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION:
The network analysis reveals:
- Hub genes that may play central roles in lung cancer
- Gene modules (communities) with similar expression patterns
- Co-expression relationships that suggest functional interactions
- Potential therapeutic targets based on network centrality

NEXT STEPS:
1. Import GraphML file into Cytoscape for advanced visualization
2. Validate hub genes through literature review
3. Perform experimental validation of key network relationships
4. Integrate with protein-protein interaction data
